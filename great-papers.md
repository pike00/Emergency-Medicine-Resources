# Great Papers + Resources

Here, I compiled a list of papers that I find useful for clinical medicine. These are not the 'seminal' papers *per se*, but rather papers that are useful to learn/solidify material. Check out [Wiki Journal Club](https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/Main_Page) for those. 

## Emergency Medicine
- [ABEM Reading Lists](https://www.abem.org/public/stay-certified/lifelong-learning-and-self-assessment-(lls)/reading-lists/archived-llsa-reading-lists)
- [Things We Do For No Reason: Treating Asymptomatic Fevers](https://shmpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.12788/jhm.3433)
	- "Only treat infected febrile patients with antipyretic medications for fever-related symptoms (headache, chills, or body aches or, in pediatric patients, irritability, malaise, or poor oral intake)."
	- "In sleeping, asymptomatic, or minimally symptomatic hospitalized patients, the risks of administering antipyretic medications clearly outweigh the benefits."

## Critical Care Medicine

- [A Practice Approach to Acid-Base Disorders (1991)](pdfs/papers/A%20Practical%20Approach%20to%20Acid-Base%20Disorders.pdf)
- [IBCC Fluid Selection + pH-Guided Fluid Resuscitation](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/fluid/)
- [Why Cardiac Monitors don't show ST Deviations Very Well (4/2022)](https://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.com/2022/04/what-do-you-think-when-you-see-st.html?m=1)
- [The Delta Gap and Delta Ratio (6/2015)](https://derangedphysiology.com/main/cicm-primary-exam/required-reading/acid-base-physiology/Chapter%20705/delta-gap-and-delta-ratio): How to interpret the "Delta Gap" and "Delta Ratio" (Also called the Delta:Delta) using physiology. (See also [Tsapenko (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3562975/))
	- If ΔAG < ΔHCO3 → There is another process causing acidosis outside of the HAGMA process → Combined HAGMA + NAGMA
	- If ΔAG > ΔHCO3 → There is another process causing **more** base that would be expected → Combined HAGMA + Metabolic *Alkalosis*
	- Fun Fact: You don't even need [HCO3] to calculate it: Delta Gap = Na - Cl - 36

## Endocrinology

- [Intensive versus Conventional Glucose Control in Critically Ill Patients (2009; NICE-SUGAR)](pdfs/papers/Intensive%20versus%20Conventional%20Glucose%20Control%20in%20Critically%20Ill%20Patients.pdf)

## Nephrology

- [Using Electrolyte Free Water Balance to Rationalize and Treat Dysnatremias (2018)](pdfs/papers/Using%20Electrolyte%20Free%20Water%20Balance%20to%20Rationalize%20and%20Treat%20Dysnatremias.pdf)
- [Contrast Nephropathy, myth thereof (EMCrit, Internet Book of Critical Care)](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/contrast/)
	- "Overall, given the massive amount of study which has been spent on this issue, it's highly reassuring that no definitive evidence of harm [of contrast material on renal function] has been found"
	- "We worry a lot about contrast nephropathy because it has its own special name.  Meanwhile, we often don't think much about other drugs [eg. Vancomycin, Aminoglycosides, Amphotericin, Acyclovir, ACEi, ARBs, NSAIDs, Mannitol], which are **proven nephrotoxins**"

## Neurology

## Ophtamology

- [Managing Patients with Acute Visual Loss (2022)](pdfs/papers/Managing%20Patients%20with%20Acute%20Visual%20Loss.pdf)

## Orthopdics

- [Managing Elbow Dislocations (2022)](pdfs/papers/Managing%20Elbow%20Dislocations.pdf)

## Evidence Based Medicine

- [Why I've Lost Faith in p values (2018, Steve Luck)](https://lucklab.ucdavis.edu/blog/2018/4/19/why-i-lost-faith-in-p-values), and [Part 2](https://lucklab.ucdavis.edu/blog/2018/4/28/why-ive-lost-faith-in-p-values-part-2)
	- "P values do not represent the probability of a Type I error in a given experiment"
- [Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations (2016)](pdfs/papers/Statistical%20tests,%20P%20values,%20confidence%20intervals,%20and%20power.pdf)
