# Great Papers + Resources

Here, I compiled a list of papers that I find useful for clinical medicine. These are not the 'seminal' papers *per se*, but rather papers that are useful to learn/solidify material. Check out [Wiki Journal Club](https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/Main_Page) for those.
