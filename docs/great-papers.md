# Great Papers + Resources

Here, I compiled a list of papers that I find useful for clinical medicine. These are not the 'seminal' papers *per se*, but rather papers that are useful to learn/solidify material. Check out [Wiki Journal Club](https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/Main_Page) for those.

## Emergency Medicine

- [ABEM Reading Lists](https://www.abem.org/public/stay-certified/lifelong-learning-and-self-assessment-(lls)/reading-lists/archived-llsa-reading-lists)

  - "Only treat infected febrile patients with antipyretic medications for fever-related symptoms (headache, chills, or body aches or, in pediatric patients, irritability, malaise, or poor oral intake)."
  - "In sleeping, asymptomatic, or minimally symptomatic hospitalized patients, the risks of administering antipyretic medications clearly outweigh the benefits."

- [Diagnostic Accuracy of Early Right Ventricular Dysfunction Markers in Normotensive Emergency Department Patients with ACute Pulmonary Embolism (2016)](/pdfs/papers/diagnostic-accuracy-of-right-ventricular-dysfunction-markers-in-normotensive-emergency-department-patients-with-acute-pe.pdf)
  - Echo for Right Heart Dysfunction has +LR of 90, -LR of 0.
  - Right Ventricle >= Left Ventricle
  - TAPSE < 10 mm
  - Flattening of ventricle towards left ventricle
- [Successful Hospitalization of patients with no discernible pathology (parody)](pdfs/papers/Successful-Hospitalization-of-Patients-with-No-Discernible-Pathology.pdf)
  - Attempt admission if:
  - Family Member + Suice to nursing staff ratio > 1.0
  - Age + BUN > 100
  - Inpatient consultant is being unreasonable
- [A Simplified and Structured Teaching Tool for the Evaluation and Management of Pulseless Electrical Activity (2014)](pdfs/papers/A-Simplified-and-Structured-Teaching-for-PEA.pdf)
  - Narrow Complex PEA → POCUS for structural causes (Tamponade, Pneumothorax, Hyperinflation, Pulmonary Embolism)
  - Wide Complex PEA → Give Na Bicarbonate, Calcium Gluconate or Chloride (Hyperkalemia, Na Blocker Toxicity)

## Critical Care Medicine

- [A Practice Approach to Acid-Base Disorders (1991)](/pdfs/papers/a-practical-approach-to-acid-base-disorders.pdf)
- [IBCC Fluid Selection + pH-Guided Fluid Resuscitation](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/fluid/)
- [Why Cardiac Monitors don't show ST Deviations Very Well (4/2022)](https://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.com/2022/04/what-do-you-think-when-you-see-st.html?m=1)
- [The Delta Gap and Delta Ratio (6/2015)](https://derangedphysiology.com/main/cicm-primary-exam/required-reading/acid-base-physiology/Chapter-705/delta-gap-and-delta-ratio): How to interpret the "Delta Gap" and "Delta Ratio" (Also called the Delta:Delta) using physiology. (See also [Tsapenko (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3562975/))
  - If ΔAG < ΔHCO3 → There is another process causing acidosis outside of the HAGMA process → Combined HAGMA + NAGMA
  - If ΔAG > ΔHCO3 → There is another process causing **more** base that would be expected → Combined HAGMA + Metabolic *Alkalosis*
  - Fun Fact: You don't even need [HCO3] to calculate it: Delta Gap = Na - Cl - 36
- [The Fifth Vital Sign? Nurse worry predicts inpatient deterioration within 24 hours](/pdfs/papers/the-fifth-vital-sign-nurse-worry-predicts-deterioration.pdf)

## Endocrinology

- [Contrast Nephropathy, myth thereof (EMCrit, Internet Book of Critical Care)](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/contrast/)
  - "Overall, given the massive amount of study which has been spent on this issue, it's highly reassuring that no definitive evidence of harm [of contrast material on renal function] has been found"
  - "We worry a lot about contrast nephropathy because it has its own special name.  Meanwhile, we often don't think much about other drugs [eg. Vancomycin, Aminoglycosides, Amphotericin, Acyclovir, ACEi, ARBs, NSAIDs, Mannitol], which are **proven nephrotoxins**"
